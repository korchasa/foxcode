# Browser Automation

## Overview

Automate browser interactions: navigate pages, click elements, fill forms, take
screenshots, extract data. Use whatever browser automation tool is available in
your environment (e.g., `playwright-cli`, Playwright MCP, `WebFetch`, `curl`).

## Instructions

<step_by_step>

1. **Detect Tool**
   - Check what browser tools are available. Prefer full browser (JS rendering,
     interaction) over HTTP-only tools.
   - If no browser tool is found, fall back to `WebFetch` or `curl` for
     read-only page access. Inform the user about limitations.

2. **Navigate**
   - Open the target URL. Wait for the page to load.

3. **Observe Before Acting**
   - Always capture page state (accessibility snapshot, DOM, or HTML) before
     interacting. Use structured data (accessibility tree, element refs) over
     raw screenshots when possible — structured data is better for reasoning.

4. **Interact**
   - Click, fill, type, select using element references from the snapshot.
   - After each interaction, re-capture page state to verify the result.

5. **Capture Output**
   - Take screenshots or extract data as requested.
   - Save files to the working directory.

6. **Clean Up**
   - Close browser sessions when finished.

## Best Practices

1. **Snapshot First**: Always capture page state after navigation or interaction
   before taking next action.
2. **Isolation**: Use separate sessions for independent tasks.
3. **Clean Up**: Always close browser sessions when done.
4. **Prefer Structured Data**: Accessibility snapshots > screenshots > raw HTML
   for element identification.
